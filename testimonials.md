### From Texas to Northwest Minnesota

> "My ex-wife, who is still my best friend, is transgender.  We have a daughter together.  We all decided Texas was no longer a safe place for my ex, our daughter, or my ex-'s girlfriend, who is also trans.  While I would have been ok in Texas, they would not have been due to anti-trans legislature that Texas has been passing and the lists of transgender people that Ken Paxton has been compiling.  Since my boyfriend is from Minnesota and since Minnesota has been protecting it's LGBTQ people, we decided it would be the perfect place to go.  More than anything, I miss my family and the food in Texas, but the safety and future of my daughter and my ex are extremely important to me.  I don't want my daughter to grow up in a state where rapists get to choose who becomes the mother of their child.  I want her to be able to control her own body and make those choices for herself, as they are no one else's business.  I'm currently in nursing school in this state, in a wonderful program and everyone is extremely friendly!  The culture here is so diverse, which I feel is necessary for children to be exposed to different peoples.  The more you experience and learn about others, the more empathetic and loving you can be.  Growing up sheltered leads to racism, sexism, and bigotry."
